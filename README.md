# GenAI Q&A Chatbot (Groq + LangChain + Streamlit)

## Overview

This project is a **Generative AI Q&A Chatbot** built using **LangChain**, **Groq API**, and **Streamlit**.  
It provides real-time, streaming responses and maintains conversational context across multiple turns.

This project marks my **entry into the field of Generative AI**, where I am actively learning and building practical AI applications.
